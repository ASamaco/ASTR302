This is partially due to the fact we are getting data from a random sample function. It is also due to the fact that I am only using a sample size of 1000 meaning that there is still room for being some randomness in the data. However, if we used a larger sample size of something like 10,000 or more, than we would start to get closer to the original values from before. I ran it again below with a sample size of 100,000 and this time I got the exact values i was looking for, for a 1$\\sigma and a 3$\\sigma$\n",

For example, if the mean is 10 events, then you can quote 10$\\pm \\sqrt{10}$.

The flux we observe for a star is the combination of the flux of the star and the flux of the sky. The flux of the sky is about $10^7$ times brighter in the daytime than at night. Lets assume that we have a star with flux 1000 units and at night the sky contributes 100 units on top of the star (so you measure 1100 units, subtract 100 units, and are left with a measureent of 1000 units).\n",
