    "Counting the number of photons in the image of a star should be straightforward. However, there are two factors that complicate this calculation. First, the star, which is effectively a point source (i.e. unresolved at any likely diffraction limit with the possible exception of some nearby red giants and optical interferometry - which we are not dealing with here), are smeared out by the atmosphere. Second, the background light, which may be non-uniform and contaminated by other resolved objects, pollutes our star of interest. We will deal with both of those factors here.\n"

In this case we are setting the FWHM of the stars to 4 pixels and only selecting sources that are greater than 5sigma detections above the background noise. This gives us the coordinates of the sources, and other ancillary information. For example the sharpness is a measure of how extended/compact the source is. The mag is an estimate of the instrumental magnitude. But we want to do a better job on determining the instrumental magnitude."

However, if we set the aperture to be very large then we end up including flux from other nearby sources. The compromise is to use a small aperture for every object and use (isolated) stars to determine the fraction of the light that gets scattered outside of this small aperture. In this first cell we measure aperture magnitudes for a set of apertures randing from 3 to 40 pixels."
